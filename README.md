# DataAnalysis

This repository is my learning journey into the world of data analysis. It contains my practice projects, notes, and resources as I explore different techniques and tools for analyzing data.

## What to Expect

In this repository, you will find:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: My experiments with datasets, where I analyze and explore the data using different techniques.
- **Data Cleaning**: Projects where I clean and preprocess raw data.
- **Visualizations**: My attempts to create various types of plots and charts using Python libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- **Practice Datasets**: Datasets that I use to practice and implement data analysis skills.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for working interactively with code)
- Required libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
